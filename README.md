##    Introduction
This covers most of the introductory part to linux with details on command-line. Folowwing the unix tree format, one is linked from  the root directory indicated by a forward slash (/) followed by the home directory. All these are like folders in a graphical user interface. The uniux tree gives an outline from the root directory to your current working directory.

##    Different linux commands
 - The text (username) that pops up with a dollar sign is referred as the Unix prompt, just like the DOS in windows terminal.

    **ls** - this command lists the contents of files and directories from the location you are or any.
             It can be the current directory or either home directory etcetera.
    
    **pwd** - this command gives a pathway from the home directory to where are working curently.
    
    **mkdir** - this command enables one to make a new directory. 
                It is possible to make sub-directories using the mkdir command, also inputing various optional unix arguments that              are put after the command, and these are usually single letters with a dash. They make work easier by avoiding a lot of typing.
                
    **cd** - this command allows one to change location or working directory from one to the other.
    
    **..** - this command allows one to steer upwards following the directory hierarchy. THis can be used with a forward slash (/) to deliminate the different directories, but with a cd command allows one to change the directory. A single dot (.) indicates the curent directory where one is. 
    
    **~** - this is a tilde which is used to take you to your home directory.
    
    **ls ..** - this is used to list directories which are above your current working directory.
    
    **ls -l** - lists the contents of a dir with extra information about the files.
    
    **ls -al** - lists all contents including hidden files. 
       
       - There are other variations of the ls command.
    
    **man** - this gives you a detailed description of a command.
    
    **rmdir** - removes an empty directory. A variation or the rm command can be 'rm -rf dir_name'. This rm comand is used to remove files and directories with files inside.
    
    **tab** - this autocompletes names of files or directories allowing you to save on time.
    
    **touch** - creating empty files that we want to work with.
    
    **mv** - moves files or directories in between directories, indication the destination to move the files. It is also used to rename files. When using an asterisk, you tell your computer to pick anything that either has specific letters or starts with or ends with.
    
    **rm** - enables one to remove files and directories. Use of -i is very key in ensuring you get a confirmation before deleting anything.
    
    **cp** - copies files, which is like moving files but you remain with copy (keeping in mind source and target). This command can also be applied to copy directories but uses the command-line options -R or -r, to mean recursively.
    
    **less** - views contents of a text file one page at a time.
    
    **cat** - displays the contents of a file. This command can be used to combine multiple files and as well make copy of an existing file with the use of a greater than sign (>).
    
    **wc** - this is a word count command, which enables one to count words, characters or even lines in file. Different variations can be used like the wc -l command.
    
    **nano** - edits the contents within a file, mainly small text files.
    
    **echo** - add lines to a text file, and also can be used to display contents of the environment variables designated with a dollar sign.
    
    **grep** -
