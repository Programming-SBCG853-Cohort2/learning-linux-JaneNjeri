##    Introduction
This covers most of the introductory part to linux with details on command-line. Folowwing the unix tree format, one is linked from  the root directory indicated by a forward slash (/) followed by the home directory. All these are like folders in a graphical user interface. The uniux tree gives an outline from the root directory to your current working directory.

##    Different linux commands
 - The text (username) that pops up with a dollar sign is referred as the Unix prompt, just like the DOS in windows terminal.

    **ls** - this command lists the contents of files and directories from the location you are or any.
             It can be the current directory or either home directory etcetera.
    
    **pwd** - this command gives a pathway from the home directory to where are working curently.
    
    **mkdir** - this command enables one to make a new directory. 
                It is possible to make sub-directories using the mkdir command, also inputing various optional unix arguments that              are put after the command, and these are usually single letters with a dash. They make work easier by avoiding a lot of typing.
                
    **cd** - this command allows one to change location or working directory from one to the other.
    
    **..** - this command allows one to steer upwards following the directory hierarchy. THis can be used with a forward slash (/) to deliminate the different directories, but with a cd command allows one to change the directory. A single dot (.) indicates the curent directory where one is. 
    
    **~** - this is a tilde which is used to take you to your home directory.
    
    **ls ..** - this is used to list directories which are above your current working directory.
    
    **ls -l** - lists the contents of a dir with extra information about the files.
    
    **ls -al** - lists all contents including hidden files. 
       
       - There are other variations of the ls command.
    
    **man** - this gives you a detailed description of a command.
    
    **rmdir** - removes an empty directory. A variation or the rm command can be 'rm -rf dir_name'. This rm comand is used to remove files and directories with files inside.
    
    **tab** - this autocompletes names of files or directories allowing you to save on time.
    
    **touch** - creating empty files that we want to work with.
    
    **mv** - moves files in between directories, indication the destination to move the files. It is also used to rename files.
